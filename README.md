Simply I build every lesson Free Code Camp lesson on my laptop, so I basically make a ton of new files every day and I'm always copy and pasting the titles, which is so irritating because I hate having the way titles are written for file names. Additionally while I type quickly, nothing is faster than copy and pasting. So I made this little app to practice my regex and string manipulation skills.

It's ugly, but I'm going to keep building it and hopefully it'll look better and better and gather some new features that I will find useful in addition to these 10 seconds saved 5-10x a day.
